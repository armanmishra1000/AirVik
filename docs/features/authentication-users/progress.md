## Existing Files Analysis
The following existing files will be enhanced rather than recreated:

### Backend Files (Already Exist):
- `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`: Auth request handlers - needs completion
- `backend/src/services/auth.service.ts`: Auth business logic - needs enhancement  
- `backend/src/models/user.model.ts`: User MongoDB schema - needs review
- `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts`: Auth API routes - needs validation
- `backend/src/services/email.service.ts`: Email functionality - needs integration

### Frontend Files (Already Exist):
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Global auth state management
- `frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts`: API communication layer
- `frontend/src/types/auth.types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
- `frontend/src/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`: User registration form

## Integration Points
This feature integrates with existing authentication infrastructure and will enhance it with:
- Complete JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Email verification system
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management
- Admin user management interface

## Architecture Decisions
- Enhance existing authentication components rather than replacing them
- Use MongoDB collections for token management (email_verification_tokens, refresh_tokens)
- Implement JWT with refresh token pattern
- Use role-based middleware for authorization
- Follow established API response format patterns

## Notes
- This is the foundational authentication feature for the hotel booking system
- All authentication components already have basic structure in place
- Focus on completing and enhancing existing functionality
- Ensure compatibility with VikBooking user management patterns
- Implement security best practices throughout
