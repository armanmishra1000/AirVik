## Completed Tasks
- [x] **B1: Enhance MongoDB Schema** (2025-07-23)
  - Updated User model with complete authentication fields (role, isEmailVerified, isActive, loginAttempts, lockoutUntil, etc.)
  - Added password hashing pre-save middleware with bcrypt
  - Created EmailVerificationToken model with expiration and usage tracking
  - Created RefreshToken model with revocation support
  - Added proper indexes for performance
  - Implemented schema validation and security best practices

## Files Created
*Format: - path/to/file.ts: Brief description of purpose*
- `backend/src/models/email-verification-token.model.ts`: Email verification token schema with expiration and usage tracking
- `backend/src/models/refresh-token.model.ts`: JWT refresh token schema with revocation support and automatic cleanup

## Files Modified  
*Format: - path/to/file.ts: What was changed*
- `backend/src/models/user.model.ts`: Enhanced with complete authentication fields, password hashing, and security features
  - Added role-based access control (CUSTOMER, MANAGER, ADMIN)
  - Implemented account lockout after failed login attempts
  - Added email verification status tracking
  - Included user preferences and metadata fields
  - Added proper validation and sanitization
  - Implemented secure JSON serialization

## Existing Files Analysis
The following existing files will be enhanced rather than recreated:

### Backend Files (Already Exist):
- `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts`: Auth request handlers - needs completion
- `backend/src/services/auth.service.ts`: Auth business logic - needs enhancement  
- `backend/src/models/user.model.ts`: User MongoDB schema - needs review
- `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts`: Auth API routes - needs validation
- `backend/src/services/email.service.ts`: Email functionality - needs integration

### Frontend Files (Already Exist):
- `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`: Global auth state management
- `frontend/src/services/auth.service.ts`: API communication layer
- `frontend/src/types/auth.types.ts`: TypeScript type definitions
- `frontend/src/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`: User registration form
- `frontend/src/components/auth/ResendVerification.tsx`: Resend verification component
- `frontend/src/components/auth/RouteGuard.tsx`: Route protection component
- `frontend/src/components/auth/VerificationResult.tsx`: Email verification display
- `frontend/src/components/auth/VerificationSuccess.tsx`: Verification success page
- `frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx`: Main app layout
- `frontend/src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`: Navigation component
- `frontend/src/components/user/EditProfile.tsx`: Profile editing form
- `frontend/src/components/user/UserProfile.tsx`: Profile display component
- `frontend/src/utils/validation.ts`: Input validation utilities

## Integration Points
This feature integrates with existing authentication infrastructure and will enhance it with:
- Complete JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Email verification system
- Password reset functionality
- User profile management
- Admin user management interface

## Architecture Decisions
- Enhance existing authentication components rather than replacing them
- Use MongoDB collections for token management (email_verification_tokens, refresh_tokens)
- Implement JWT with refresh token pattern
- Use role-based middleware for authorization
- Follow established API response format patterns

## Notes
- This is the foundational authentication feature for the hotel booking system
- All authentication components already have basic structure in place
- Focus on completing and enhancing existing functionality
- Ensure compatibility with VikBooking user management patterns
- Implement security best practices throughout
